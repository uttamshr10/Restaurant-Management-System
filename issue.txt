## I haven't push it to main branch yet so all of the issues are in second branch.
1. First Issue:- mainscreen() -> default [when I enter a character, it runs indefinitely].
-> What I figured out is, It is because of recursive function. So, it can't be solved. If I don't make it recursive,
   the system will exit, If I make it I will get the indefinitely running issue.

2.  reviews() -> [space is not taken]
-> I want the user to give a review of maximum 200 character long with spaces which is not supported with gets(), puts()
   and %[^\n] this thing.

3. Inside, text.c -> authentication part
-> I want the user to set username and password, and later login with same username and password for authentication to 
   access admin section.
   -> Solution: 1. Can I make the set username and password as global variable and compare it with login username and password variable
                   to get the authentication complete?
   -> Solution 2. Do the same thing and also split Admin Section and Waiter section making 3 total section 
                  1. Admin section for setting username and password.
                  2. Waiter section for getting orders, removing orders.
                  3. Customer section.

4. How can we stop getting the set username and password section everytime we run our program?
-> What I mean to say is, If I set admin section for setting username and password to access admin section, User can 
   directly go to this section and add new username and password everytime. And they can get accesss to admin section too.
   How can I first set username and password and it will be locked, once they set the username and password they
   shouldn't prompt to set username section ever again and if they want to sneak peak inside admin section they will be
   required username and password which is already set by the admin already at first.
